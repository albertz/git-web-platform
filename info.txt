run:
  node make.js

  it might fail at the end with this msg:

	./find-deps.js src/core.js > build/jsgit.js

	D:\external-projects\jsGit\git-web-platform\make.js:14
	  if (err) throw err;
	                 ^
	Error: spawn ENOENT
	    at errnoException (child_process.js:988:11)
	    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:779:34)

  but that doesn't matter (I think). I think it's just the uglifyjs.


When you run that, you will most likely get some missing-module error.
Install all the missing mods via:

  in this dir:
    npm install <missing-mod>

  This will install them into the subdirectory node_modules.

Except for js-git. Go into node_modules, and git clone the repo (
https://github.com/creationix/js-git). Checkout version 0.5.4.
